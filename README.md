# emotion-map-ios

## Motivation
This is inspired by my former colleague and fellow student [Jasir El-Sobhy](https://github.com/jelsobhy)'s project [emotion-map](https://github.com/jelsobhy/emotion-map), which is a Andriod App that tracks users emotions and mark it on a map.

This Application is a usage example for the [Microsoft Cognitive Services Emotion API] (https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api) which is used to track the users emotions during the usage of his IPhone.
